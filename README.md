Pluto is a unique dialect of Lua, which aims to specialize for general-purpose programming.

### Why should you choose Pluto?
- **Accelerated Development.**
  - Greatly enhanced standard library.
  - Dozens of additional VM & compile-time optimizations.
  - Several new syntaxes, such as switch statements or ternary expressions.

- **Drag & Drop Compatibility.**
  - Compatible with Lua 5.4 source & bytecode.
  - The only Lua dialect that's proven it can be dropped into massive [communities](https://stand.gg/) (50K> users), and not break any existing scripts.
