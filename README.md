# Pluto
Pluto is a fork of the Lua 5.4.4 programming language. Internally, it's mostly PUC-Rio Lua 5.4, but as I continue to make small modifications, over time it'll be its own little thing. This is why I ascribed the name 'Pluto', because it'll always be something small & neat. The main changes right now are expansions to Lua's syntax, but performance optimizations and QoL features like optional compile-time warnings are under development too.

Pluto will retain a heavy focus on portability, but it will be larger & less light-weight than Lua. I intend on adding features to this that'll make Lua (or in this case, Pluto) more general-purpose and bring more attention to the Lua programming language, which I deeply love. Pluto will not grow to the enormous size of Python, obviously, but the standard library will most definitely be expanded. So far, many operators have been added & overhauled. There are new virtual machine optimizations, new syntax such as lambda expressions & string indexing, and more that you can read below.

Thanks to everyone who's provided a star towards Pluto. I do notice every single person that does so, and it provides me excellent motivation to continue working on Pluto. On this note, please do send PRs and plenty of bug reports if you stumble upon any. All help is appreciated.
