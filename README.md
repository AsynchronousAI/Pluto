Pluto is a unique dialect of Lua, which aims to specialize for general-purpose programming.

### Why should you choose Pluto?
- **Accelerated Development.**
  - Greatly enhanced standard library.
  - Dozens of additional VM & compile-time optimizations.
  - Several new syntaxes, such as switch statements or ternary expressions.

- **Drag & Drop Compatibility.**
  - Pluto is mostly compatible with Lua 5.4 source & bytecode.
    - It implements new keywords, which can cause conflicts with otherwise normal identifiers such as 'switch', or 'class'. We offer features — such as Compatibility Mode — to relieve this issue, see our [documentation](https://pluto-lang.org/docs/Compatibility).
  - With Compatibility Mode, Pluto has proven it can be dropped into massive [communities](https://stand.gg/) (100K> users), and not break any existing scripts.
